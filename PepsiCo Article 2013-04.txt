The soft drink and snack food giant reported third-quarter net income of $1.9 billion, or $1.23 per share, besting consensus estimates of $1.8 billion and $1.18 per share. Earnings were flat with the same period last year.

Net sales were up 1.5%, to $16.9 billion slightly below $17 billion analyst estimates.

Slow or declining growth in beverage segments was offset by growth in food divisions. PepsiCo Americas Beverage sales were down 2% to $5.4 billion. Asia, the Middle East and Africa were down 3% to $1.6 billion and Europe was up 3% to $3.8 billion.

On the other hand, PepsiCo Americas Foods sales were up 5% to $6.1 billion with 5% growth from Frito-Lays and 9% from Latin America Food. The Quaker Foods division was down 2%.

Total operating profit for the company was $2.7 billion, down 1%. Losses at the corporate level were balanced by gains in both beverage and snack divisions. PepsiCo says it is on track to cut $900 million in 2013 due to productivity initiatives, part of a three year plan to chop $3 billion in costs.

This summer billionaire Nelson Peltz told CNBC that Pepsi should acquire Mondelez International before dividing into separate beverage and snack divisions. This morning CNBC asked Warren Buffett what he thinks of the break-up idea. The Berkshire Hathaway billionaire -- who does not own Pepsi shares -- responded, "Well one of them is a terrific business and the other is a perfectly good business. Why break them up?"

Pepsi shares were up .1% in pre-market trading. After a tumultuous day in Washington led to a broad market decline, PepsiCo shares closed down slightly on Tuesday at $80.60, but have outpaced rivals this year with 14.7% year-over-year growth.

Yesterday, competitor  Coca-Cola reported an increase in earnings on down sales. Europe and North America limited the behemoth's revenue slide, but the slower rate of emerging market gains is a concern. Coke ended trading down .66% to $37.66, virtually flat from October of last year.

Monster Beverage is down 4.9% from this time last year and  Dr Pepper Snapple Group  is down 1.8%.
