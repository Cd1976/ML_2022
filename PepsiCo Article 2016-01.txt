PepsiCo (PEP) reported higher earnings per share for the third quarter Thursday morning, defying forecasts for a small drop. Sales continued to fall for the snacks and beverage giant, but less than expected.

PepsiCo, which makes everything from Pepsi soda to Cheetos and Gatorade and Quaker Oats, earned $1.40 a share in Q3, up 4% vs. $1.35 a year earlier. Analysts had expected a 2% dip to $1.32.

Revenue fell 2% to $16.03 billion, the seventh straight quarter of declining sales vs. a year earlier. But it was the smallest drop in six quarters and above the consensus forecast for $15.83 billion.

North American sales climbed 3% to $5.52 billion.

Overall organic revenue, excluding currency effects and Venezuela, rose 4.2%.

Pepsi raised its full-year forecast to $4.78 a share from $4.71. Analysts had expected $4.76.

Pepsi has a solid 2.8% annualized dividend yield, based on a quarterly payout of 75.25 cents a share. It was most recently raised in February, from 70.25 cents a share. PepsiCo is not part of IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, but the company historically has a long history of paying regular dividends.

Pepsi shares rose as high as 109.71 on the stock market today, but closed up just 38 cents at 107.76. Pepsi has been trading in a flat base since mid-July with a 111.04 potential buy point but has been finding resistance at its 50-day moving average.

Coca-Cola (KO) broke below its 200-day line in late July after it reported weak revenue and guidance. Shares have continued to slide. Coca-Cola fell 0.3% to 42.03, hitting an 8-month low intraday.

Dr Pepper  Snapple (DPS) hit a record high soon after its latest earnings report, but has since slumped, falling through its 50-day line in August and its 200-day line earlier this month. Dr Pepper Snapple fell 0.6% to 90.72.
