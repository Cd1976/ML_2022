PepsiCo Inc. (NYSE: PEP) announced on Thursday that its profit nearly doubled in the last quarter, boosted by similarly strong sales in the emerging markets, but like rival Coke the company saw weaker volumes in North America.

The maker of Pepsi-Cola drinks and Frito-Lay snacks reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, or 90 cents per share, a penny off the pace of 91 cents per share that was expected by analysts. In the same quarter last year the company earned $719 million, or 46 cents per share.

Revenue for PepsiCo increased 4.5 percent to $13.3 billion, slightly topping the market estimate of $13.27 billion.

"We continued to invest in R&D, infrastructure and innovation to sustain our long-term growth," PepsiCo Chairman and CEO, Indra Nooyi, said. "In 2010, we are changing the rules of the game in North America beverages through the anticipated merger with our anchor bottlers coupled with the continuing activities to refresh our core brands."

In the North America beverage volume for the company fell by 5 percent with its food unit remaining flat.

PepsiCo performed strong in Asia, Africa and the Middle East where snack sales jumped 13 percent and beverage volume rose 5 percent, due in large part to strong growth in India. In Europe, snack volume fell 3 percent and beverage sales were flat.

The company reaffirmed its forecast for earning growth in 2010, with growth of 11 percent to 13 percent excluding special items.

PepsiCo also expects to complete its $7.8 billion acquisition of its two largest bottlers by the end of the current month in an effort to relieve tensions between the companies and reduce production costs.

Shares of PepsiCo are up 69 cents in early market movement to $61.07 on Thursday.
