Pepsi Refresh Project 2010: America’s Ideas Spur Refreshing Change
In 2010, Pepsi proved that anyone anywhere can motivate and inspire Americans to move the world forward. Since February, all 50 states have participated by voting in the Pepsi Refresh Project. With over 61 million votes cast via www.refresheverything.com, the Pepsi Refresh Project is on track to award more than $20 million in grants to over 400 ideas in 2010.



Here’s a look at what this year’s Pepsi Refresh grantees have accomplished, from building playgrounds in communities across the U.S., to providing instruments to students, to supporting energy efficiency installations:

26 Parks and playgrounds that have been built or improved
30 Prom outfits that have been donated to high school seniors who could not afford them
50 States that have voted for ideas in the Pepsi Refresh Project
54 Schools that have been improved

123,332 Miles grantees have traveled by foot, bike and skate on Pepsi Refresh Project-funded action trips

In addition to the ideas realized above, there are 133 projects underway that would otherwise have been scaled back, or nonexistent.

“We’re looking forward to continuing and expanding the Pepsi Refresh Project in new directions. We’ve asked all our fans on Facebook to share their thoughts on what matters most and to provide us with ideas on how to improve the program for 2011. These insights have helped us shape the program next year,” commented Jill Beraud, chief marketing officer of PepsiCo Americas Beverages.
